# Smart Karabakh Hackathon
## Lunatic Btye

Our Project solves 5 major transport-based problems : 
- Smart parking
- Smart lighting
- Smart pedestrian area
- âœ¨Weather conditions
- Driver safety based on weather conditions

## Smart parking
##### Solves :
- Waste fuels 
- Increases pollutions
- Causes anxiety
- Produce traffic-jams

##### Smart parking system can reduce : 
- 30% fuel saving
- Time spent looking for parking reduced 40% 
- Green house gas emissions' reduced 40%
- Traffic volume reduced 8%

Additionally, nearly 42% of the U.S. respondents said they missed an appointment, 34% abandoned a trip because of parking issues and 23% experienced road rage, the report said.

We have created mobile and web application. Tourists, civils can download mobile app. In order to use mobile app, they have to register mobile application. Because mobile app will provide unique QR - code for each person that will be used for entering parking area. People will see parking areas on map, they can select and reserve their own parking places before reaching parking areas. But don't forget, you have 15 minutes to reach parking area. Otherwise predefined fee will be applied and your reservation will be canceled. People can see their remaining time, and can get direction to the destination. Also drivers can check weather temperature, humidty. This data helps us to predict some road related conditions. Tourists and also civil people can check informative section that demonstrate history of Karabakh. 

Web application was created for admin. Admin can manage all parking areas. Admin will use Smart lighting sections for changing minimum level of street lights.  

## Smart lighting

##### Solves : 

 -  Energy consuption
 -  Short life of the lights 
 -  Pedestrian safety 

When target starts to close street lights, next ones will increase their brightness to 100%. For default it is working with 20%. This project idea has effective for long roads. Pedestrian areas have same working principles with smart street lights. Both of them are using ultrasound sensor to detect objects. We have lights on pedestrian areas which increase their brightness regularly when the pedestrian close to this area to notify drivers there is a pedestrian or not.
